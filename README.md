# OmniEats (Made by Tien Do and John Dockery)
# Description
In this project, I will be making a database system for food deliveries on campus by utilizing SQL. My SQL is used for generating database. MYSQL Dump will be here after I work on MySQL code/database.
# Business Rules
* In this database we will have 3 different kinds of users to log in: Students, Deliverer and Admin users. 
* Students will able to edit their cart before the Deliverer gets to the location of the desired location.
* Deliverer will be able to update their status
* Admin are able to see the deliverID but are not able to delete it.
# Use Case
Students will be able to log in with their student account from the University. Students will able to make an order to be delivered to them. Admins will able to view the deliver request and edit it but are not able to delete the deliver request. The Deliverer will be able to update the request when needed.
# Description of Future Work:
In the future we will have a website made first for students to order on campus. This will only be used for students around the campus and no one outside of campus. An app will be future implemented after the website is finished.
# EERD
The diagram will have a Student logging in to make orders.The students will be able to make orders will the Admin could view the orders and are able to make changes. The deliverer are only able to update the order and view it. This database will have about 4 tables for now. Students, the order and location which are the deliveries and an admin table.
# Trigger
Orders or an order will have a trigger. When you order it will send a confirmation number or receipt to your email.
# Stored Procedure
A stored procedure would the the Student IDs
